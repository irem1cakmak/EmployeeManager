"# EmployeeManager" 
# Employee Manager

This project was developed as part of Java practice tasks.

It demonstrates:
- Reading user input with `Scanner`
- Object creation using constructors
- Constructor overloading
- Using `this()` for constructor chaining
- Basic console output formatting

## Question 13 – Employee Class with Full Information

In this task, an `Employee` object is created by taking the following inputs from the user:
- Name
- Surname
- Salary
- Country
- Task

### Features
- Uses a constructor with all fields
- Prints employee information to the console

---

## Question 14 – Constructor Overloading

In this task, constructor overloading is implemented in the `Employee` class.

### Constructors
- `Employee(String name, String surname, int salary, String country, String task)`
- `Employee(String name, int salary)`
- `Employee(String name)` → assigns a default salary using `this(name, 1000)`

### Concepts Used
- Constructor overloading
- `this()` keyword
- Default values
